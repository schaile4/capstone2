# National Parks Capstone

# Overview 
This web application provides facts about national parks and mountains located in the United States. The objective of this project was to create a user friendly application for users to navigate a databases using HTML, javascript, and css. This project taught me a lot about time management, JavaScript, and the importance of utilizing the resources available to you.

# HTML pages
Homepage (capstone.html)
- This is the main page of the project. It is very simple and meant to feel nostalgic to the user, but easy to navigate. There are navigation links to the other HTML documents for users to explore the website. At the bottom of the page there is a game for users to interact with. I intended to develop it a bit more and create an actual board with decorations, borders, and objects to interact with while you play but time did not permit. I still left it on the page unfinished because it still is fun to press the buttons and it fit the aesthetics. 

Explore Parks(parks.html)
- This page is for the user to explore parks inside of the database. The drop down boxes act as a filter. You can select a state or a park type and it will show parks that fit the description. This page frustrated me the most. I planned on using an actual interactive map with pins that you can click and view the information inside of a card. There was something off with the coordinates and I was having trouble learning fast enough to implement all of my ideas in a timely manner. The HTML document is still included but not linked to the project.

View Mountains (mountain.html)
- The mountains page is one of my favorites. I like how the buttons work very seamlessly and the aesthetics. You select a mountain youâ€™d like to learn about, click submit, and then information pops up. ![NationalParksPage](https://github.com/schaile4/capstone2/assets/122303426/fa048baa-08d4-4adc-b8c9-88d9f90ff755)
